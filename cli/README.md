# Create Cyber App

_NOTE: this is extremely early and not finished_

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm create cyber-app@latest`
2. Install deps with your preferred package manager
3. Fill in the `.env.` based on the `.env.example`
4. Start the dev server with the dev command

## DEV NOTES

- The main point of this project is to handle the Auth, Database, and Deploy story
- Things like tailwind, prettier, vitest, etc. should be added with "svelte-add" to lower complexity and make this more maintainable in the long term
